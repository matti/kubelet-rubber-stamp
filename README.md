# kubelet-rubber-stamp

kubelet-rubber-stamp is simple CSR auto approver operator to help bootstrapping kubelet serving certificates easily.

The logic used follows the same logic used when auto-approving kubelet client certificates in kubelet [TLS bootstrap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#approval) phase.

So basically the flow is:
1. kubelet gets the client cert (see [TLS bootstrap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#approval))
2. Kubelet creates a [CSR](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#create-a-certificate-signing-request-object-to-send-to-the-kubernetes-api)
3. kubelet-rubber-stamp reacts to the creation of a CSR
    - validates that it's a valid request for kubelet serving certificate
    - validates that the requestor (the kubelet/node) has sufficient authorization
    - approve the CSR
4. Kubelet fetches the certificate
5. Kubelet auto-rotates certs, goto 2 :)
